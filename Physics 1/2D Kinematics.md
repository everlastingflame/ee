We already know the definitions of [[Kinematics]] in one dimension, so now we can explore everything in more than just that.

The position vector can be defined in 2d with unit vectors $\hat{i}, \hat{j}$ to represent the x and y axes, with magnitude 1. 
$$
\vec{r}(t)=x(t)\hat{i}+y(t)\hat{j}
$$
As stated previously, the derivative of the position function is the velocity, that is defined as follows:
$$
\vec{v}(t) = \frac{dx(t)}{dt}\hat{i}+\frac{dy(t)}{dt}\hat{j} = v_{x}(t)\hat{i}+v_{y}(t)\hat{j}
$$
Acceleration is the same. 
$$
\vec{a}(t)=\frac{dv_{x}(t)}{dt}\hat{i}+\frac{dv_{y}(t)}{dt}\hat{j}=a_{x}(t)\hat{i}+a_{y}(t)\hat{j}
$$
