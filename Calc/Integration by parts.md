Sometimes in [[Calculus]] we find ourselves with integrals that cannot be solved normally using u-sub, and need to be solved using integration by parts. 

The general form of integration by parts is:
$$
\int u\, dv=uv-\int v\,du
$$
Example:
$$
\begin{align}
&\int xe^x \, dx \\
&u = x, \, du = 1 dx,  dv = e^x\, dx, v = e^x \\
& xe^x - \int e^x \cdot 1 \, dx  \\
& xe^x - e^x
\end{align}
$$

$v$ is the integral of $dv$
