One of many [[Continuous Distributions]] as well as Discrete, the continuous version is similar to the discrete case where the variable $X$ can take on any value, but this time it only takes on values on a smooth curve bounded by an interval. The probability that $X$ lay on an interval is proportional to the length of the interval. 
$$
\begin{align}
f(x) = \frac{1}{b-a}, \, \text{for } \, x \in [a,b] \\
\mu = \frac{a+b}{2}, \, \sigma^2 = \frac{(b-a)^2}{12} \\
m(t) = \frac{e^{bt}-e^{at}}{t(b-a)}
\end{align}
$$
$m(t)$ is the moment-generating function
