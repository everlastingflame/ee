[[Continuous Distributions]]
Also know as the Gaussian distribution, takes parameters $\mu, \sigma^2$, which are real numbers, $\sigma^2$ being strictly positive with positive square root $\sigma$. 
$$
\begin{align}
&f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{ 2\pi }}\exp\left( -\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right), \text{for} \, x \in \mathbb{R}
 \\
&\mu = \mu, \sigma^2 = \sigma^2 \\
&m(t) = \exp\left( \mu t+ \frac{t^2\sigma^2}{2} \right)
\end{align}
$$
The standard normal distribution has $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma^2 = 1$.
