[[Probability]]

The expectation of a random variable is just the weighted average value it takes on, the weight representing the probability of the realization. 

For discrete random variables, this is denoted as:
$$
\sum_{x}xP(X=x)
$$
For continuous random variables, this is just:
$$
\int_{-\infty}^\infty xf(x)\, dx
$$
A conceptual way to think of the expectation is as the center of mass of the distribution.
