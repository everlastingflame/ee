Another one of the [[Discrete Distributions]]. The geometric distribution describes the number of trials it takes until the first success is reached. Each trial has a probability $p$ of success. 

$$
\begin{align}
&f(x) = q^{x-1}p , \, \text{for}\, x =1,2,\dots,n \\
&\mu = \frac{1}{p},\, \sigma^2 = \frac{1-p}{p^2} \\
&m(t) = \frac{pe^t}{1-qe^t}
\end{align}
