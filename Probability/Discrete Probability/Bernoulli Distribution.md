$\text{Bernoulli}(p)$ is one of many [[Discrete Distributions]] where $p \in [0,1]$, taking on two values, success or failure, $1$ or  $0$. The probability of success is $P(X=1)$ is the parameter $p$ and the probability of failure $P(X=0)$ is the parameter $q$. This distribution purely describes whether a trial is a success or not. 

$$
\begin{align}
f(0) = 1-p, \,  f(1) = p \\
\mu = p, \, \sigma^2 = p(1-p) = pq\ \\
m(t) = pe^t + q
\end{align}
$$
Example (once again) flipping a fair coin, $p = \frac{1}{2}$, $\mu =\frac{1}{2}$, $\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{4}$
