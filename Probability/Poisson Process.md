[[Probability]]
A Poisson process is a set where time is continuous and there is a rate $\lambda$ of events occurring per unit of time, the same for any time interval. All the events occur independently of each other. If you ask how many events happen on a time interval $t$ your answer will have a Poisson distribution  $\text{Poisson}(\lambda t)$. If you ask how long until an event happens, you will have an exponential distribution, $\text{Exponential}(\lambda )$. If you ask how long until the $r^{\text{th}}$ event, then that is a gamma distribution, $\text{Gamma}(\lambda, r)$. If there are $\alpha + \beta$ events in a given time interval and you ask what fraction of the time interval it takes until the $\alpha^{th}$ event occurs, then the answer will have a Beta distribution, $\text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta)$
