[[Probability]]

A **Random Variable** is a variable who's value is unknown or a function that assigns values to each of an experiments outcomes. 

Usually, to denote a random variable, we use the big $X$. When this notation is used, this indicates that $X$ is unknown and can take on any value from the set it is distributed in. When we use the little $x$, this is the outcome or realization of the random variable, this value is known since it has taken on a value from the set. Commonly this is seen as $P(X=x)$, which just indicates the probability that the random variable $X$ takes on the value $x$.
