It is possible to describe the behavior of [[Ordinary Differential Equations]] around solution points. As we have seen from calculus 1, we can find the rate of change or slope at certain points in the form of  
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x,y)
$$
We can use this rate of change as a slope, this tangent line also known as the lineal element. If we consider:
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = 0.2xy, f(x,y) = 0.2xy
$$
We can say that the lineal element at point $(2,3)$ is just simply $f(2,3) = 1.2$ 
Collecting all of these lineal elements allows us to create direction or slope fields, which we analyze over a rectangular grid. These slope fields tell us what the family of solutions look like and how they behave.
