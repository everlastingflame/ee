As we have seen before, first order [[Ordinary Differential Equations]] are in the form:
$$
a_{1}(x) \frac{dy}{dx} + a_{0}(x)y=g(x)
$$
We know this is linear since there is a linear equation in the variable $y$

We also have learned standard form too for [[Ordinary Differential Equations]], which can be expressed generally for linear equations
